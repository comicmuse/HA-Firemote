## How to use
1. On any dashboard, click the +ADD CARD button
1. Search by cards for "Firemote Card" and click on it
1. Under the **Device Family** dropdown, choose "Amazon Fire", "Apple TV",  "Chromecast", "NVIDIA Shield", or "Xiaomi"
   - Amazon, Shield, Xiaomi, Chromecast, or Android TV users:
     - Under **Device Model**, select the device model that you own. (Help: Which [Amazon Fire](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/device-specifications.html) or [NVIDIA Shield](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/shield/)  device do I own?)
     - Under the Android Debug Bridge Entity dropdown, a list of your Android Debug Bridge integration entities will appear.  Select the one you wish to control.
     - If you are setting up something other than an Amazon Fire device, select the Associated Android TV Remote Entity that points to the same device as your Android Debug Bridge entity.  This step is not required, but it will greatly improve the speed and reliability of your Firemote card
   - Apple TV Users
     - Under **Apple TV Device Model**, select the device model that you own
     - Under **Apple TV Media Player Entity**, select the Apple TV Media Player entity you wish to control
     - Under **Apple TV Remote Entity**, select the Apple TV remote entity that is associated with the Apple TV Media Player Entity you chose in the previous step
1. Make any other optional changes to your card, then click "SAVE"  Other options include changing the app launch buttons to apps that you use most often, or changing the style of your remote control to look like something completely different from what shipped with your device.  You can even add names and adjust the size of your Firemote card too!

## App Launch Button Customization
Custom app launch buttons are not limited to the few that came printed on your remote control.  In fact, the possibilities are endless!  If you don't see your favorite app on this list, you can click on the [Issues](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/issues) button on the top of this page, click 'New Issue' and then click the "Get Started" button next to the "App Shortcut Request" option.  Your request is important to you and likely important to others as well!  As long as the app is easily downloaded through your device's app store (not sideloaded), your request will be granted ASAP.

## Button Overrides
Button Overrides can be very useful for customization.  These overrides can be used to call a Home Assistant service directly, run a script, or hide a button on your remote.  These options are accomplished through your Firemote's YAML configuration.

Consider this example:
```yaml
button_overrides:
  mute-button:
    script: receiver_mute_script
  volume-down-button:
    script: receiver_volume_down_script
  volume-up-button:
    service: light.toggle
    target:
      entity_id: light.bedroom_lamp
    data:
      color_name: red
      transition: 2
      brightness_pct: 100
  power-button:
    hidden: true
```

Valid button names are as follows:
 - app-switch-button
 - apps-button
 - back-button
 - center-button
 - channel-down-button
 - channel-up-button
 - down-button
 - fastforward-button
 - hamburger-button
 - headset-button
 - home-button
 - input-button
 - keyboard-button
 - left-button
 - mute-button
 - playpause-button
 - power-button
 - programmable-one-button
 - programmable-two-button
 - restart-button
 - rewind-button
 - right-button
 - search-button
 - settings-button
 - tv-button
 - up-button
 - volume-down-button
 - volume-up-button

## FAQ
###  Why won't the volume, mute, and/or power buttons work from my Firemote card?
In many cases, your remote control sends commands for volume, mute, and power to your TV or receiver using the IR emitter on the front of the physical remote control.  These IR commands cannot be sent in a traditional Home Assistant setup.
<br>

If your player device AND the device they are connected to both offer CEC options, then activating CEC will allow the Firemote card controls to work as expected.  [Click here](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/wiki/Using-CEC-Controls) to learn more about how to [configure CEC to work with your Firemote](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/wiki/Using-CEC-Controls).  Another option might be to control your devices (TVs, Receivers, etc.) using [Button Overrides](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote#button-overrides).  If you can control those kinds of devices through Home Assistant, you can write a HA script and attach that script to a button on your Firemote.
<br>

Due to the way the Apple TV Home Assistant integration is built, an Apple TV style Firemote cannot properly simulate a "Mute" button press.  A [Button Override](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote#button-overrides) will be required in this case.
<br>
<br>

### Why don't any of the buttons on the Firemote work at all? ###
 * If your Firemote used to work perfectly, and some or all of the buttons suddenly stopped working, it could be that all you need to do is press one button (any button) on your Fire TV device's physical remote control.  After doing that step, try your Firemote again.  This step most commonly fixes the issue in Amazon Fire devices after they are powered on, restarted, or updated.
 * Check your card configuration:
   * Is the correct Android device selected?
   * Is the correct Device Family selected?
   * Is the correct Device type selected?
   * If you are using it, is the correct matching Android TV Remote Entity selected?
   * Is Compatibility Mode set to Default?
 * If the Default Compatibility Mode is not working on your device, and you've checked every other step, slowly choose "event0", "event1", etc. and test your remote buttons under each mode.  One of these will work.
<br>

### Why isn't my Amazon Fire Device supported?
There are over 40 kinds of Amazon Fire devices, so it will take a while to gain properly tested support for all of them.  If Firemote doesn't support your Amazon Fire device yet, you can still use Firemote!  Simply choose a supported device that is similar to the one that you have (preferably a remote that looks the same as your physical remote), then you can test different compatibility modes to find out which one works the best.<br>

For extra credit, you could submit a request to have your device added!  It's simple!  Click on the [Issues](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/issues) button on the top of this page, click 'New Issue' and then click the "Get Started" button next to the "Device Support Request" option.  Your help is VERY appreciated!

### Why do only some of the Firemote buttons for the Apps that came with my Apple TV work properly, while others don't?
Apple TV app shortcuts work simply by passing the name of the app to the apple tv remote entity.  Firemote is built and tested against an environment that uses English as the primary language.  In some scenarios, built-in Apple TV apps use language app specific names, which is why asking it to open the English version of that app's name does not work.  In order to overcome this, I request that you click the [Issues](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/issues) button at the top of this page so we can work together and make all of these buttons work in your native language.
<br>
<br>

### I want a shortcut button for an app I use frequently, but it's not on the list.  Can it be added?
Absolutely!  Simply ask!  Here's how: Click the [Issues](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/issues) button at the top of this page, click 'New Issue' and then click the "Get Started" button next to the "App Shortcut Request" option.  Your request is important to you and likely important to others as well!  If the app is easily downloaded through your device's official store (not sideloaded), your request will be granted ASAP.
<br>
<br>

### How do I report a problem, make a request, or talk about stuff?
Click on the [Issues](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/issues) button at the top of this page, click 'New Issue', and select the appropriate category for your needs.  You're also welcome to join or begin a new [discussion](https://github.com/PRProd/HA-Firemote/discussions) if that suits your needs.
